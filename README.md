This is a repo for the personal practices in Python.

Three folders are here for starters and hopefully as I learn, I will create
independent folders for each of the folders.

While you are surfing through this repo, kindly go through each code
and reach out to me on twitter if you want us to discuss on them.

In case you do not know by now, I am a Software Engneering student at Semicolon
Africa, who is rather ambitious.

I am not scared to learn and it has a lot to do with my dogged black roots and
family  culture. I am Ozioma Okoroafor. Let's connect now.
