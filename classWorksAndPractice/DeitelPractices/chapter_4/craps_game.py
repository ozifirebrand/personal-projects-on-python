# die one and two are rolled
# the sum of the two faces determines if player wins, loses or continues
# game
# A sum of 7 or 11 means win, the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll (called “craps”), you lose (i.e., the “house”
# wins). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first roll, that sum becomes your
# “point.” To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you “make your point”
# (i.e., roll that same point value). You lose by rolling a 7 before making your point.
